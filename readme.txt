New multiple file CSV exporter for 2014 by WebTechGlobal. I have company intranets in mind (not just online WP) when planning future updates for this plugin. So whatever you see now is only the early design. 

== Description ==

Select the tables you wish to export to one or multiple .csv files. My goal is to offer control over all aspects of the
exported .csv file/s i.e. name the headers rather than defaulting to database column names. This will come in use for
automated features i.e. generate .csv files automatically and deliver them using email or simply placing them in a selected
directory. My approach is going to be the duplication of PHP functions and HTML forms - then adapt them to suit a different need. The idea
is to avoid changing existing features in use. This will require an expanding interface which the WTG CSV Exporter offers.

To begin with the plugin will be simple though. Contributions of any kind (even a Tweet or a Facebook like helps) will
drive us towards the next update.

= When To Update = 

Browse the changes log and decide if an update is required. There is nothing wrong with skipping version if it does not
help you - look for security related changes or new features that could really benefit you. If you do not see any you may want
to avoid updating. If you decide to apply the new version - do so after you have backedup your entire WordPress installation 
(files and data). Files only or data only is not a suitable backup. Every WordPress installation is different and creates a different
environment for WTG Task Manager - possibly an environment that triggers faults with the new version of this software. This is common
in software development and it is why we need to make preparations that allow reversal of major changes to our website.

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

These are the rules followed to increase the WTG CSV Exporter plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
